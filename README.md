## Cogs

* [attendance](https://github.com/PureLoneWolf/Nymeria-Cogs/tree/master/attendance) - A cog to take the attendance of a particular voice channel and output it

## Support
This cog was made for me as a [bounty] (https://cogboard.red/c/bounties/7) over at [cogboard.red] (https://cogboard.red).  The original author did not want to publish, but confirmed that the code was now mine to do with as I wish.  So support would need to be done via an issue on here and I will reach out to the original author for help.

Feel free to fork and change as you need to fit your requirements :)

## Acknowledgments

* My thanks to the original author, they know who they are :)
