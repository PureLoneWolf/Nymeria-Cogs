# Attendance Cog

A cog to take the attendance of a particular voice channel and output it

## Installation

```
[p]attend
```

## Commands

## Known Issues
Due to the paging option, if you have a voice channel where the name is just a number, the cog cannot distinguish between a paging request and the channel name, so it will not report attendance from such channels.
